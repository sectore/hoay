# The `src.assets` Directory

There's really not much to say here. Every file in this directory is recursively transferred to `dist/assets/`.
`ngBoilerplate` populates it only with a few font files - Font Awesome for icons and Roboto for page
text - and an Internet-Explorer-only stylesheet to make Font Awesome work.
